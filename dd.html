    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Dhanush I am a passionate web developer with a strong
      interest in creating beautiful and functional websites. I have
      several years of experience working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
      and I enjoy learning new technologies to expand my skillset.
    </p>
    <p>
      My goal is to develop user-friendly and responsive web solutions
      that meet the needs of clients and provide a seamless browsing
      experience. I love collaborating with others and bringing creative
      ideas to life through coding.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the great outdoors,
      playing the guitar, or indulging in a good book. Feel free to
      contact me if you have any questions or if you'd like to work
      together on a project.
    </p>
